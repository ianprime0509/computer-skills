    <h1>Clicking the mouse</h1>
    <p>
      In this lesson, we will learn about how to use the mouse to interact with
      things on your computer, like this web page right here. Since you're
      using a computer, you probably know about how to move the mouse around,
      and how the <span class="vocab">cursor</span> (it probably looks like an
      arrow for you) moves with it. On a web page like this, look for visual
      clues like <u>underlines</u> and <span style="color:
      #0000EE">colors</span> to find <span class="vocab">links</span> and other
      interactive elements to click on.
    </p>
    <h2>The cursor</h2>
    <p>
      Paying attention to the cursor is very important when using the mouse.
      The shape of the cursor can give you clues as to what actions you can
      perform by clicking. For example, <span class="vocab">hover</span> your
      mouse over this link to see what happens to the cursor: <a href="#">hover
      over me!</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you did that right, the cursor should have turned into the shape of a
      hand! When the cursor looks like that, a <span class="vocab">left
      click</span> will interact with the thing your cursor is pointing at. For
      example, clicking on a link will usually take you to another web page.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may have also noticed the cursor turn into a different shape when you
      hover over the text on this web page. This cursor shape is sometimes
      called the <span class="vocab">I-beam</span>, since it looks like the
      letter <b>I</b> on most computers. Whenever you see the I-beam shape, you
      know that you can interact with the text under the cursor.

    <h3>Exercises</h3>
    <p>
      Test your understanding by finding the clickable links in the list below.
      Be sure to pay attention to the shape of the cursor!
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Can you click me?</li>
      <li><a href="#" id="clickme1">Maybe!</a></li>
      <li><a href="#" id="clickme2">Just be sure to look at the
          cursor.</a></li>
      <li><u style="color: #0000EE">Some styles are deceptive.</u></li>
      <li><u style="color: #551A8B">It can be tricky...</u></li>
      <li><a href="#" id="clickme3">The cursor shouldn't lie, though!</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Your score: <span id="clickme_score"></span>
