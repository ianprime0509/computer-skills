# Computer skills

This is intended to be a basic computer skills "course", with a very
work-in-progress name. Just a little experiment to see how it turns
out :)

## TODO

1. Add navigation header to each page
2. Finish a couple lessons
3. Get GitHub Pages set up for viewing
4. Make an intro page to explain how the lessons work
